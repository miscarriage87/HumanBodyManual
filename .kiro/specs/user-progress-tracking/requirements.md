# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Progress Tracking System is a comprehensive feature that enables users of the Human Body Manual application to monitor, track, and visualize their journey through various body optimization techniques. This system will provide users with meaningful insights into their practice consistency, improvements over time, and achievement milestones, fostering long-term engagement and motivation for their wellness journey.

The system addresses the critical need for users to see tangible progress in their body optimization practices, understand which techniques are most effective for them personally, and maintain motivation through gamification elements and visual progress indicators. This feature transforms the application from a static reference tool into a dynamic, personalized wellness companion.
