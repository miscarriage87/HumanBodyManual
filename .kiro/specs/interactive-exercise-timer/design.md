The system integrates seamlessly with the existing Human Body Manual application while introducing advanced features like real-time HRV monitoring, adaptive visual breathing guides, immersive environments, and progressive skill development.

The design emphasizes user experience, scientific accuracy, and spiritual enhancement, creating a bridge between ancient wellness practices and modern biometric technology. The system is built to be extensible, allowing for future integration with various wearable devices and biometric sensors while maintaining the application's core aesthetic and philosophical principles.

## Architecture

### System Architecture Overview

The Interactive Exercise Timer follows a modular, event-driven architecture that supports real-time data processing and responsive user interactions:

```

**Timer Engine**: Core orchestration service that manages exercise sessions, timing, and state transitions. Handles session lifecycle, pause/resume functionality, and coordination between different system components.

**Biofeedback Service**: Processes real-time biometric data from connected devices, calculates HRV metrics, coherence scores, and provides adaptive feedback based on physiological responses.

**Audio/Visual Engine**: Manages immersive environments, breathing guide animations, and synchronized audio experiences. Utilizes Web Audio API for precise audio timing and Canvas/WebGL for smooth visual animations.

**Device Integration Layer**: Abstracts communication with various wearable devices and heart rate monitors through standardized APIs, supporting Bluetooth Web API and vendor-specific SDKs.

**Analytics Service**: Processes session data, generates insights, tracks progress patterns, and feeds the adaptation engine for personalized recommendations.
