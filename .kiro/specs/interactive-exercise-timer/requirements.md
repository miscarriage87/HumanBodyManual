## Introduction

The Interactive Exercise Timer with Biofeedback is an advanced feature that transforms the existing basic exercise timers in the Human Body Manual application into intelligent, adaptive guidance systems. This feature provides real-time visual and audio guidance for breathing exercises, meditation sessions, and other timed practices while incorporating biofeedback elements to help users optimize their technique and achieve deeper states of relaxation and focus.

The system addresses the need for more engaging, effective, and personalized exercise experiences by providing visual breathing guides, heart rate variability (HRV) integration, adaptive timing based on user performance, and immersive audio-visual environments that enhance the spiritual and therapeutic aspects of each practice.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user practicing breathing exercises, I want an intelligent visual breathing guide that adapts to my natural rhythm, so that I can achieve optimal breathing patterns and deeper relaxation states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a breathing exercise THEN the system SHALL display an animated breathing guide with smooth expansion and contraction cycles
2. WHEN the user's breathing pattern is detected THEN the system SHALL adapt the visual guide to match their natural rhythm within healthy parameters
3. WHEN a user follows the breathing guide THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback on timing accuracy and consistency
4. WHEN breathing exercises include hold phases THEN the system SHALL display clear visual indicators for inhale, hold, and exhale phases
5. IF a user's breathing becomes irregular THEN the system SHALL gently guide them back to the optimal pattern with visual cues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interested in biofeedback, I want to connect my heart rate monitor or wearable device to see real-time HRV data during exercises, so that I can optimize my practice for maximum nervous system benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects a compatible heart rate device THEN the system SHALL display real-time heart rate and HRV metrics during exercises
2. WHEN HRV data indicates optimal coherence THEN the system SHALL provide positive visual feedback and encouragement
3. WHEN HRV patterns suggest stress or poor coherence THEN the system SHALL suggest breathing adjustments or technique modifications
4. WHEN an exercise session is completed THEN the system SHALL show HRV improvement metrics and coherence scores
5. IF no biometric device is available THEN the system SHALL offer manual stress/relaxation level tracking as an alternative

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user seeking immersive experiences, I want customizable audio-visual environments during exercises, so that I can create the optimal atmosphere for my practice and enhance the spiritual aspects of my wellness journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an exercise THEN the system SHALL offer multiple ambient environment options (forest, ocean, mountain, sacred space)
2. WHEN an environment is selected THEN the system SHALL display corresponding visual backgrounds with subtle animations
3. WHEN exercises are in progress THEN the system SHALL play synchronized ambient sounds that complement the breathing rhythm
4. WHEN users want customization THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of visual intensity, sound volume, and color themes
5. IF a user prefers minimal distractions THEN the system SHALL offer a clean, minimalist timer interface option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user practicing various exercise types, I want intelligent session adaptation that adjusts timing and difficulty based on my performance and biometric feedback, so that I can progressively improve my practice effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects consistent good performance THEN it SHALL suggest progression to longer sessions or advanced techniques
2. WHEN biometric data indicates stress or difficulty THEN the system SHALL offer to reduce session intensity or duration
3. WHEN a user completes multiple sessions THEN the system SHALL track improvement patterns and suggest optimal session timing
4. WHEN environmental factors affect performance THEN the system SHALL adapt recommendations based on time of day, weather, or user-reported energy levels
5. IF a user struggles with a particular technique THEN the system SHALL offer alternative approaches or preparatory exercises

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user wanting to track my technique improvement, I want detailed session analytics and progress insights, so that I can understand how my practice is affecting my nervous system and overall well-being.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is completed THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report including timing accuracy, HRV improvements, and technique scores
2. WHEN multiple sessions are completed THEN the system SHALL show progress trends in breathing consistency, relaxation depth, and session duration
3. WHEN biometric data is available THEN the system SHALL correlate exercise performance with stress reduction and recovery metrics
4. WHEN users view their analytics THEN the system SHALL provide personalized insights and recommendations for improvement
5. IF users want to share progress THEN the system SHALL generate beautiful, shareable progress summaries with privacy controls

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user practicing in different contexts, I want smart session scheduling and reminders that consider my circadian rhythm and stress levels, so that I can practice at optimal times for maximum benefit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system learns user patterns THEN it SHALL suggest optimal practice times based on historical performance and circadian rhythms
2. WHEN stress indicators are high THEN the system SHALL proactively suggest appropriate calming exercises with gentle notifications
3. WHEN users set practice goals THEN the system SHALL send intelligent reminders that adapt to their schedule and preferences
4. WHEN environmental conditions are optimal THEN the system SHALL notify users of ideal practice opportunities
5. IF users miss scheduled sessions THEN the system SHALL adjust recommendations and provide motivational support without guilt-inducing messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user interested in advanced techniques, I want access to guided progressive training programs that unlock based on my mastery level, so that I can systematically develop my skills and explore deeper practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user demonstrates mastery of basic techniques THEN the system SHALL unlock intermediate and advanced exercise variations
2. WHEN users complete progressive milestones THEN the system SHALL award technique mastery badges and unlock new content
3. WHEN advanced techniques are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed guidance and safety considerations
4. WHEN users struggle with advanced techniques THEN the system SHALL offer step-by-step progression paths and preparatory exercises
5. IF users want structured learning THEN the system SHALL provide curated learning paths for specific goals (stress reduction, sleep improvement, focus enhancement)
